notebook: contains the test notebook of the code 

# Main elements of the model
The main model is implemented via the class Model, which is defined in Model_EASY.py. Some parts were sourced out in another separate file: 

•	During the initialization of a Model_EASY, values from the Agent class are imported. 

•	The class Agent is defined in Agent_EASY.py.

•	The mechanisms of the Academic Institutions are defined via their own class Academic_Institutions. This class is defined in Model_EASY.py.

The class Model, which is defined in Model_EASY.py reads a parameter file, runs the model and creates a  graph of the results. 

# Using the model
There is one way to run the model:
1.	Conduct a single model run using Model_EASY.py directly. This only works for a single parameter constellation.
